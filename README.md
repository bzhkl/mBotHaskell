# mBotHaskell

Repository of the mBot project from the course "Functional and Logic Programming Languages" of the study "Master of Science in Mathematical Informatics" at Ghent University. I had to design and implement a basic interpreter for a fictional programming language based on one or more existing languages. The interpreter has to be written in Haskell. I also had to extend this self-written language making it possible to control an educational 'mBot' robot.
