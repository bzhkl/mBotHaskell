# mBotHaskell

Repository of the mBot project from the course "Functional and Logic Programming Languages". I have to design and implement a basic interpreter for a fictional programming language based on one or more existing languages. The interpreter has to be written in Haskell. We have to extend this self-written language so it's possible to control an education 'mBot' robot.
